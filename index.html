          <h3>Technical Service</h3>
          <p>I started my service journey 15 years ago in the financial industry. I have worked with Automated and Interactive Teller Machines (ATM or ITM), Locks, 
            Vacuum Assist Tube Lanes (VAT Lanes), and security systems. I also have a background in retail and networking systems including, registers/selfcheckouts, routers,
            switches, servers, and printers.

          <h3>Support</h3>
          <p>With my extensive background in service, I have also assisted in supporting customers and field technicians. I have trained new and experienced technicians
            in practical troubleshooting applications to solve minor to complex issues with many types of equipment. I have also worked closely with customers to train on 
            various systems and equipment to better understand their equipment and perform minor troubleshooting.
